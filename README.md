# Font-End
This is my front-end Hackathon project, i did where you 
i created a button where the api request a quote from 
the breaking bad api or ron swanson api. 
Once the api recieves the quote, it displays on the
the browser. Then theres two buttons where you click
either the "ron swanons quote" button or the "breaking bad"
button. and when you click the right button in accordance with
the quote , then the browser tells you if you got it right 
or wrong.
